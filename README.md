# Arithmetic-Expression-Parser


This project contains two implementations of the same program. The program
can evaluate mathamatical expressions containing any number of the '+', '-',
'/', '*' operators (e.g. (5 + 8)* 2 ). The program can also solve single 
variable equations by performing a binary search between hardcoded min and
max values. 
 
The c implementation is a command line tool, and the swift implementation
is wrapped in a launchable Mac OS X Application. The main purpose of this 
poject was to document.
